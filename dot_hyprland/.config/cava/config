[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires
# a terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.
# default is to keep current terminal color
; background = default
; foreground = default

# SDL and sdl_glsl only support hex code colors, these are the default:
; background = '#111111'
; foreground = '#33ffff'


# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors are supported,
# background must also be defined in hex or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off.
# You can define as many as 8 different colors. They range from bottom to top of screen
 # gradient = 1
 # gradient_count = 8
 # gradient_color_1 = '#9967c4'
 # gradient_color_2 = '#9967c4'

 # gradient_color_4 = '#7aa2f7'
 # gradient_color_5 = '#f7768e'
 # gradient_color_6 = '#f7768e'
 # gradient_color_7 = '#f7768e'
 # gradient_color_8 = '#f7768e'

[smoothing]

# Percentage value for integral smoothing. Takes values from 0 - 100.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
# DEPRECATED as of 0.8.0, use noise_reduction instead
; integral = 77

# Disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing" with or without "waves". Set to 0 to disable.
; monstercat = 0
; waves = 0

# Set gravity percentage for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster.
# Accepts only non-negative values. 50 means half gravity, 200 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
# DEPRECATED as of 0.8.0, use noise_reduction instead
; gravity = 100


# In bar height, bars that would have been lower that this will not be drawn.
# DEPRECATED as of 0.8.0
; ignore = 0

# Noise reduction, int 0 - 100. default 77
# the raw visualization is very noisy, this factor adjusts the integral and gravity filters to keep the signal smooth
# 1 will be very slow and smooth, 0 will be fast but noisy.
; noise_reduction = 77


[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# Remember to uncomment more than one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
