# NOTE:
# Those are specific keybinds for my laptop & the external keyboard keys note that those keybinds
# may not work in your case. So in order to configure your spcial keys you need to have "xor-xev" installed
# on your system to read the code generated by that key with the command "xev -event keyboard".
# EX: My volume-up key's code = 123,
# See: (https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-keysyms.h)

# Extranl keyboard keys
bind =, XF86AudioLowerVolume, exec, pamixer -d 5 # volume controller-down "external keyboard"
bind =, XF86AudioRaiseVolume, exec , pamixer -i 5 # volume controller-up "external keyboard"

# Laptop keyboard keys
bind =, XF86AudioMute, exec, pamixer -t # mute
